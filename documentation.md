* **Conducted some background research into superconducters**
* **Attended the CHESS user meeting and lab training**

<br> 

## Wednesday, June 8th, 2022
* **Attended Wilson safety training**
* **Created introduction to superconducters presentation slide**
* **Searched for materials database**
1. [Supercon Database](https://en.iric.imet-db.ru/DBinfo.asp?idd=51)
2. [ICSD Database](https://icsd.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/) (not just superconducters, the world's largest database for completely identified inorganic crystal structures )

<br> 

## Thursday, June 9th, 2022

* **Looked into matminer documentation**

<br> 

## Friday, June 10th, 2022

* **Started testing matminer featurizers and automatminer**
* **Worked on python package conflicts with automatminer (issue with sklearn depreciating a metric import)**

<br>

## **Week 2:**
---

<br> 

## Monday, June 13th, 2022
* **Intro to Accelerator Science Workshop**
* **REU weekly meeting**
* **CLASSE 998 Safety Training**
* **Abandon automatminer for a manual implementation due to unresolved package errors**
* **Worked more on testing matminer featurizers, still having some issues getting proper composition data.**

<br> 

## Tuesday, June 14th, 2022
* **Library information session**
* **Composition issues fixed, featurizers working correctly**
* **Testing some machine learning algorithms**
* **Looking into the compute farm, as some of the featurizers have time estimates higher than an hour**
