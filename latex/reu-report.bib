	abstract = {As materials data sets grow in size and scope, the role of data mining and statistical learning methods to analyze these materials data sets and build predictive models is becoming more important. This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies.}

	abstract={One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is theobservation of room-temperature superconductivity1,2. Recently, high-temperature conventionalsuperconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systemsunder high pressure3--5. An  important discovery leading toroom-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation ofhydrogen sulfide (H2S) to H3S, with aconfirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155gigapascals3,6. Both H2S andCH4 readily mix with hydrogen to form guest--hoststructures at lower pressures7, and are of  comparable sizeat 4 gigapascals. By introducing methane at low pressures into theH2S + H2 precursor mixture forH3S, molecular exchange is allowed within a largeassemblage of van der Waals solids that are hydrogen-rich withH2 inclusions; these guest--host structures become thebuilding blocks of superconducting compounds at extreme conditions. Here we reportsuperconductivity in a photochemically transformed carbonaceous sulfur hydridesystem, starting from elemental precursors, with a maximum superconductingtransition temperature of 287.7 {\textpm} 1.2 kelvin (about 15 degrees Celsius) achieved at267 {\textpm} 10 gigapascals. The superconducting state is observed over a broad pressurerange in the diamond anvil cell, from 140 to 275 gigapascals, with a sharp upturn intransition temperature above 220 gigapascals. Superconductivity is established bythe observation of zero resistance, a magnetic susceptibility of up to 190gigapascals, and reduction of the transition temperature under an external magneticfield of up to 9 tesla, with an upper critical magnetic field of about 62 teslaaccording to the Ginzburg--Landau model at zero temperature. The light, quantumnature of hydrogen limits the structural and stoichiometric determination of thesystem by X-ray scattering techniques, but Raman spectroscopy is used to probe thechemical and structural transformations before metallization. The introduction ofchemical tuning within our ternary system could enable the preservation of theproperties of room-temperature superconductivity at lower pressures.},
